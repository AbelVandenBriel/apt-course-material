= Design Patterns

According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern[Wikipedia], a design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occuring problem.
There are plenty of examples of design patterns, such as

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutator_method[Getters and setters]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern[Strategy]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern[Factory method]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern[Iterator]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_pool_pattern[Object pool]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern[Composite]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern[Singleton]

Let us have a closer look at some of these.

== Getters and Setters

=== Java

Take a quick look at the code below.

[source,java]
.Java Interval class: public fields
----
public class Interval
{
    public double lowerBound;

    public double upperBound;

    public Interval(double lowerBound, double upperBound)
    {
        this.lowerBound = lowerBound;
        this.upperBound = upperBound;
    }

    public double getWidth() { return upperBound - lowerBound; }
}
----

You were taught never to make fields public, but to define getters and setters instead, as shown below.

[source,java]
.Java Interval class: correct implementation
----
public class Interval
{
    private double lowerBound;

    private double upperBound;

    public Interval(double lowerBound, double upperBound)
    {
        setLowerBound(lowerBound);
        setUpperBound(upperBound);
    }

    public double getLowerBound() { return lowerBound; }
    public double getUpperBound() { return upperBound; }

    public void setLowerBound(double lowerBound) { this.lowerBound = lowerBound; }
    public void setUpperBound(double upperBound) { this.upperBound = upperBound; }

    public double getWidth() { return getUpperBound() - getLowerBound(); }
}
----

But why do this?
Why go to all this extra trouble while clearly the wrong version provides the exact same functionality as the correct version?

The reason is that you never know beforehand how your class will evolve.
Software engineering is not about making your code work, but also prepare it for potential future changes.
For example, in ``Interval``'s case, we could choose to forbid it from having `lowerBound` be greater than `upperBound` (note that this restriction is **not** a particularly good idea.)

In the version with public `lowerBound` and `upperBound` fields, there is no way for us to enforce this rule.
We would need to make the following modifications:

* Prohibit direct access to the fields by making them private.
* Allow the user to read the fields' values by introducing `getLowerBound` and `getUpperBound`.
* Allow the user to change the fields' values by introducing `setLowerBound` and `setUpperBound`.
  Both these methods should validate their inputs and throw an exception in case the rules are violated.

[source,java]
.Java Interval class: correct implementation
----
public class Interval
{
    private double lowerBound;

    private double upperBound;

    public Interval(double lowerBound, double upperBound)
    {
        setLowerBound(lowerBound);
        setUpperBound(upperBound);
    }

    public double getLowerBound() { return lowerBound; }
    public double getUpperBound() { return upperBound; }

    public double getWidth()      { return getUpperBound() - getLowerBound(); }

    public void setLowerBound(double lowerBound)
    {
        if ( lowerBound > upperBound )
        {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException();
        }

        this.lowerBound = lowerBound;
    }

    public void setUpperBound(double upperBound)
    {
        if ( lowerBound > upperBound )
        {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException();
        }

        this.upperBound = upperBound;
    }
}

But why not make these changes when necessary?
Originally, no restriction was in place, so no getters or setters were necessary.
Only after the extra rule was imposed did the need arise for them.
We could start off with public fields and then migrate to getters and setters as necessary.

This is a bad idea as the client code would be impacted:

[source,java]
.Java
----
var interval = new Interval(0, 10);
interval.upperBound += 1;
----

would need to be updated to

[source,java]
.Java
----
var interval = new Interval(0, 10);
interval.setUpperBound(interval.getUpperBound() + 1);
----

If changing a class leads you to have to update client code, you know you've made a design mistake.
One of your main priorities should be to ensure that change can remain localized: you don't want a modification to ripple through your entire code base.
Here, getters and setters form a kind of a "barrier": they allow you to update the class without this affecting the outside world.

In other words, Java forces you to "preventively overengineer" your class so that future changes don't impact other code.
This is known as the **Uniform Access Principle**.

=== Uniform Access Principle

[quote, Bertrand Meyer, Object-Oriented Software Construction]
All services offered by a module should be available through a uniform notation, which does not betray whether they are implemented through storage or through computation.

The Uniform Access Principle states that the syntax should not betray whether you are accessing data (a field) or code (a method).
Java uses different syntax for each:

[source,java]
.Java
----
// Field access
object.member

// Method access
object.member()
----

The parentheses betray that you are in fact calling a method.
Java can be said that it violated the Uniform Access Principle.
To circumvent this problem, Java programmers simply pretend there is no such thing as fields: if every (public) member is a method, there is nothing else to be inconsistent with.
All member accesses need parentheses.

This approach works, but as mentioned above, it requires a bit of boilerplate code, so much so that Java IDEs provide ways to automatically generate getters and setters for you.
It is the opinion of this writer that any language that requires such code generation is severely flawed.

But how do other languages solve this problem?

=== C#

C#'s https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties[properties] allow you to gracefully turn data (fields) into code.
Let's start with public fields:

[source,csharp]
.C# Interval with public fields
----
public class Interval
{
    public Interval(double lowerBound, double upperBound)
    {
        this.LowerBound = lowerBound;
        this.UpperBound = upperBound;
    }

    public double LowerBound;

    public double UpperBound;

    public double Width
    {
        get { return UpperBound - LowerBound; }
    }
}
----

We update this code to include the restrictions on `LowerBound` and `UpperBound`:

[source,csharp]
.C# Interval with properties
----
public class Interval
{
    private double lowerBound;

    private double upperBound;

    public Interval(double lowerBound, double upperBound)
    {
        this.LowerBound = lowerBound;
        this.UpperBound = upperBound;
    }

    public double LowerBound
    {
        get { return lowerBound; }
        set
        {
            if ( value > UpperBound )
            {
                throw new ArgumentException();
            }

            this.lowerBound = value;
        }
    }

    public double UpperBound
    {
        get { return upperBound; }
        set
        {
            if ( LowerBound > value )
            {
                throw new ArgumentException();
            }

            this.UpperBound = value;
        }
    }

    public double Width
    {
        get { return UpperBound - LowerBound; }
    }
}
----

Usage of the `Interval` class is the same, regardless of whether `LowerBound` and `UpperBound` are implemented as regular fields or properties:

[source,csharp]
.C#, usage of Interval
----
var interval = new Interval(0, 10);
interval.UpperBound += 10;
----

In the case that `UpperBound` is a property, ``UpperBound``'s `set` code will be executed where `value` is set to its new value.

[NOTE,caption={cakepoint}]

There actually still is a Uniform Access Principle violation, but where?
====

Due to this hidden violation, it is still highly recommended not to work with public fields in C# and to only expose properties.
In order to limit the need for boilerplate, C# offers a shorthand notation for getters and setters that perform no additional tasks but getting and setting a variable, respectively.

[source,csharp]
.C# Interval with auto-implemented properties
----
public class Interval
{
    public Interval(double lowerBound, double upperBound)
    {
        this.LowerBound = lowerBound;
        this.UpperBound = upperBound;
    }

    public double LowerBound { get; set; }

    public double UpperBound { get; set; }

    public double Width => UpperBound - LowerBound;
}
----

Here, `{ get; set; }` generates a private field and code that gets and sets this field.
In other words, some boilerplate code is still required in order to preserve the Uniform Access Principle.
